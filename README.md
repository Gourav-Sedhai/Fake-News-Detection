# Fake-News-Detection
Detecting Fake News with Python.
-------------------------------
Fake News:
A type of yellow journalism, fake news encapsulates pieces of news that may be hoaxes and is generally spread through social media and other online media. This is often done to further or impose certain ideas and is often achieved with political agendas. Such news items may contain false and/or exaggerated claims, and may end up being viralized by algorithms, and users may end up in a filter bubble.

So this project is based on building a model to accurately classify a piece of news as REAL or FAKE.

This python project of detecting fake news deals with fake and real news. Using sklearn, we build a TfidfVectorizer on our dataset. Then, we initialize a PassiveAggressive Classifier and fit the model. In the end, the accuracy score, the confusion matrix and the classification report tell us how well our model fares.
